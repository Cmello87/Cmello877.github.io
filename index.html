        <p class="blog">So I started my first class todaym I'm so excited and nervous at the same time. I have never taken a computer class before!  They are teaching us about programming and designing web pages. We have so much homework & the class is online so I need to stay on top of it to get good grades.</p>

        <p class="blog">OMG we did our first programming project today and I was actually not as confused as I expected I would.I did my first design project and built a recipe book from scratch. It took me so long to complete , I felt like I was going so slow. I'm proud of myself because I submitted all my homework and I also passed all my quizzes with an A YAY FOR ME!! .</p>
